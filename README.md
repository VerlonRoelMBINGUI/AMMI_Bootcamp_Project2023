Opinion Mining of Ukraine-Russia War publications on X social media Using Deep Learning


 The primary goal of this study is to analyze public sentiment expressed in publications on X about the Ukraine-Russia war conflict. This involves using deep learning methods to extract and understand the nuanced opinions and emotions embedded in the text of these tweets. By harnessing the powerful capabilities of BERT and RoBERTa, this research aims to uncover insights into public sentiment trends, polarization, and emotional dynamics surrounding this significant geopolitical issue. In this study, we used data preprocessing, training and validation of the BERT and RoBERTa model with Literature, and model evaluation using the metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
